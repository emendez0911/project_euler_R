# Project Euler Solutions using R

These are my propossed solutions in R for problems 1-50 of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) archive. 


## Description

I used only base R functions (whenever they were needed) and the [gmp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/index.html) package for those cases involving arithmetic operations with big integers. I also compiled a couple of functions that I used the most, and uploaded them to GitHub. You can find them [here](https://github.com/emendez0911/EulerFunctions). 

## Check them out!

To get the R package with the functions I used:

```
library('devtools')
devtools::install_github('emendez0911/EulerFunctions')
```

For the functions in the package, you can go the [folder](https://github.com/emendez0911/EulerFunctions/tree/master/R) on GitHub to see the R files for each function. You can also visualize the function code by typing the name without the parentheses:

```
get_primes
```

I hope I can add more solutions to this repo in the future. Any suggestion or feedback would be really appreaciated.
